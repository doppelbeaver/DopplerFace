# DopplerFace
Final Project for CS 386W. Inspired by the paper Soundwave: using the doppler effect to sense gestures (Gupta et. al.) and the code by @DanielRapp, we implemented an algorithm to detect face-touching movement. 

## Abstract
Amid the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, health organizations andgovernmental authorities around the world have advised people notto touch their faces. We proposeDopplerFace, a novel face-touchingdetection model, which utilizes the Doppler effect on acoustic sig-nals.DopplerFacecan be installed on any commodity laptop com-puter with built-in microphone and speaker. It will issue a warningwhen the human sitting in front of the laptop attempts to touch hisof her face. Unlike existing face-touching detection models, whichare based on camera input or wearable device sensors, DopplerFace is computationally cheaper, and unlikely to raise privacy concerns
